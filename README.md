# Welcome to PicoGK

**PicoGK** (“peacock”) is a compact, open-source geometry kernel developed by [LEAP 71](https://leap71.com/).

It serves as the foundation of a broader technology stack for [Computational Engineering](https://leap71.com/computationalengineering/), a new paradigm pioneered by LEAP 71.

The name stands for **Pico** (tiny) **G**eometry **K**ernel, and the library offers [a deliberately reduced](https://jlk.ae/2023/12/06/the-power-of-reduced-instruction-sets/) yet powerful instruction set designed to create computational geometry for engineering applications.

“PicoGK” is also a nod to the peacocks that roam the streets of Dubai — our home city and the birthplace of this technology.

While it may appear minimal on the surface, PicoGK is used to generate some of the most advanced physical components imaginable: from electric motors and heat exchangers to [3D-printed rocket engines](https://leap71.com/rp/) and bio-inspired structures.

We believe **Computational Engineering** will radically transform how we design the physical world. With PicoGK, our aim is to help accelerate this shift — empowering engineers to build a future that is both inspiring and sustainable.
